### Code Explanation

This Python code snippet utilizes NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to generate a simple grayscale image and display it using the imshow function.

1. **Importing Libraries**: 
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```
    - `numpy` library is imported and aliased as `np`.
    - `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` library is imported and aliased as `plt`.

2. **Creating Initial Array**: 
    ```python
    im = np.arange(49)
    ```
    - Creates a one-dimensional NumPy array `im` containing numbers from 0 to 48.

3. **Displaying Initial Array**: 
    ```python
    im
    ```
    - Displays the contents of the `im` array.

4. **Checking Array Shape**: 
    ```python
    im.shape
    ```
    - Returns the shape of the `im` array, which is (49,), indicating it has 49 elements.

5. **Adding a New Axis**: 
    ```python
    im = im[np.newaxis, :]
    ```
    - Adds a new axis to the `im` array to convert it into a two-dimensional array with shape (1, 49) using NumPy's `np.newaxis` feature.

6. **Displaying Modified Array**: 
    ```python
    im
    ```
    - Displays the modified `im` array.

7. **Checking Modified Array Shape**: 
    ```python
    im.shape
    ```
    - Returns the shape of the modified `im` array, which is now (1, 49).

8. **Doubling the Height of the Image**: 
    ```python
    im = np.repeat(im, 2, axis=0)
    ```
    - Repeats each row of the `im` array twice along the 0th axis, effectively doubling the height of the image. After this operation, the shape of `im` becomes (2, 49).

9. **Displaying Further Modified Array**: 
    ```python
    im
    ```
    - Displays the further modified `im` array.

10. **Checking Further Modified Array Shape**: 
    ```python
    im.shape
    ```
    - Returns the shape of the further modified `im` array, which is now (2, 49).

11. **Plotting the Image**: 
    ```python
    plt.imshow(im, cmap='gray')
    ```
    - Plots the image represented by the `im` array using Matplotlib's `imshow` function. The `cmap='gray'` argument specifies that the image should be displayed in grayscale colormap.

This code snippet provides a step-by-step explanation of how the grayscale image is generated and displayed.
